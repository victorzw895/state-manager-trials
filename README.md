## About

This is a sample project used to trial different libraries and tools.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```Run local development with React Hooks
npm run dev
```

<!-- ```Run local development with XState Machine
npm run dev-xstate
``` -->

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## State Management

Using this sample application to trial and compare different state management libraries using react-context as a base standard (although it is not a state manager, but often used as one).

For flexibility, all these contexts, stores and providers will be wrapped in custom hooks and may not be necessary for regular standard use.
